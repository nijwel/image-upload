$image = $request->input('image'); // Input image.
$newImageName = 'my_image'; // IF you want to rename image (Also you can send null value) .
$width = 200; // Desired width, (if you want to original image width pass value 0 or null).  
$height = null; // Desired height (null means maintain aspect ratio , You can handle manually)
$path = 'backend/assets/images/'; // Directory to save the image

// Just call in your method

```

## Methods
`imageUpload($file, $newImageName = null, $width = null, $height = null, $path = 'images/')`
